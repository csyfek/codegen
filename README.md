# codegen
Multi-purpose code generator for JSON, YAML, SQL, and Go.

This tool is a blind rewrite of prior tools that I've written and used that were much less modular or clearly written.

This is currently a work in progress. At the time of writing, various parts of the code work, but there is no useful interface in place.

Those who have worked with me have probably seen code generated by this tool or one of its ancesters. Its ancestors were typically a small web-app with a basic HTML (no JavaScript) interface for various kinds of transformations. My intent with this tool is to make it much more capable by inspecting entire source files and packages during the data gathering stage.
